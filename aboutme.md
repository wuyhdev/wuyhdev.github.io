**INFJ-A \| Highly Sensitive \| Python Dev**

**Nailed** Data Structures, but a **total flop** in Probability & Stats.  
Experienced in **frontend** and **database** development, with **Python** as my go-to language.  
Passionate about **ACG**, with **Asuka Langley** from **EVA** being my favorite character.  
Also a movie buff - check out [**My Top 10 Movies**](https://www.douban.com/doulist/149957537/).
